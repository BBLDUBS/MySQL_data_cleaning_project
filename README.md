# MySQL_data_cleaning_project

In this project, I take a raw data and transform it in MySQL Workbench server to make it more usable for analysis. This project was primarily for data cleaning. However, it can also be seen as Exploratory Data Analysis reason being that to clean data you have to apply data exploratory skills. In this project I did both simultaniously while focusing more on transforming data.

This is a dataset for layoffs around the world. After performing EDA, I came to a conclusion that most of these layoffs or rather their large numbers is due to COVID 19. During this period most people lost their jobs, were retrenched or were forced to stay at home to avoid infection and spreading of the disease. As we all know, some jobs require commutement to office and so others could not go to work due to lockdown.
